 RWD became virtal when cross platform interfaces has been on trendy. One design should be effectively adapt on many screen sizes of different devices.
 Back then, designers might use fluid grid calculationt to make the layout more flexible. However, the result didn't end up well; for example, the image wasn't
rearranged well with the change in resolution or viewport size. Generally, the old, so-called flexible design created by fluid grid rendered context well enough
in desktop screen but didn't fully response with other display size.
 The media query inspect into a horizontal resolution of a device and decide whether the website opened on smaller or wider screen device. It helps the layout 
and any container scaled down effectively to fit them with any narrower resolution that passed the indicated query in css (eg : mobile phone, tablet etc...).
 To assign paragraph responsively,em is also a better option which is a relative length for font-size .That means it refers to parents element and can be easily 
scale when there's a change in display device's resolution. 
 In conclusion, to make UI as a responsive design, developer can take advantage of jQuery, and bootstrap framework with build-in grid layout for css or flexbox 
was introduced in css2 as an alternative.
